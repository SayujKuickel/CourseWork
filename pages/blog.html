            But also beware of its conscequences
          </h3>
          <p>
            the main negative impact of technology is addiction. People gets
            very attached technology that without technology they cannot do
            anything. Another negative impact is privacy, there is no guarantee
            that people uses technology for good purposes. Technology can effect
            people privacy too. Technology also causes pollution. The industrial
            machines waste are straight dumped in rivers an ocean which leads to
            water pollution not only that it also create air pollution by
            releasing industrial harmful smoke in air. Over use of technology
            can effect peoples life, it can cause physical disorder like eye
            strain ,Sleep problems ,depression and anxiety.
